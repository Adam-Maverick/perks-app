# Product Brief: Stipends

**Date:** 2025-11-20  
**Author:** Adam  
**Context:** Enterprise B2B2C Financial Wellness Platform

---

## Executive Summary

**Stipends** is a full-stack B2B2C financial wellness platform designed to address the financial stress epidemic facing Nigerian employees. With inflation eroding purchasing power while salaries stagnate, Nigerian workers—especially young professionals—are financially stretched with limited access to savings, perks, or financial wellness programs. The root barrier is fear of scams from unverified emerging brands, compounded by employers lacking zero-cost retention tools in a competitive talent market.

Stipends solves this through a **multi-layered trust and enablement ecosystem**: a verified merchant marketplace aggregating discounts, employer-funded employee stipends, and escrow protection for emerging brands. The platform uniquely positions as a **Tax-Optimized Financial Wellness Engine**, combining immediate savings with **ethical, payroll-backed BNPL financing** (launching Phase 4) to provide a complete financial safety net.

**Primary Value Proposition:**
- **Multi-layer trust**: Merchant vetting + escrow + employer endorsement (addresses Nigeria's scam fear barrier)
- **Financial enablement**: Discounts + employer-funded stipends + aggregated savings (solves affordability and fragmentation)
- **Ethical Credit Access**: Fair, transparent BNPL (₦5k-₦20k limits) built on proprietary infrastructure (Phase 4)
- **Enterprise integration**: Payroll systems for stipend distribution, SSO, email marketing with PWA app
- **Mission-aligned**: Anti-predatory lending - focus on savings first, with credit as a safety net

**Strategic Value-Add:**
- **Tax optimization angle**: Leverages Nigeria Tax Act 2025 provisions (50% additional welfare deduction + rent relief proof) — *requires validation with tax experts*
- **Localized focus**: Nigeria-specific vetting, Naira-based, addresses local fraud concerns

**Target Market:** B2B2C model targeting Nigerian mid-size to enterprise companies (100+ employees) and their workforce, starting with a hyper-local pilot in Lagos business districts (Ikeja/VI).

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Nigerian employees face a compounding financial crisis:

**Root Cause (Five Whys Analysis):**
1. **Why are employees financially stressed?** → Nigeria's inflation is reducing real incomes
2. **Why can't they save?** → Salaries remain stagnant while cost of living rises
3. **Why don't employers help?** → Most companies offer no benefits beyond salary and basic health insurance
4. **Why don't employees access discounts/deals?** → Fear of scams and fake products from unverified emerging brands creates a trust barrier
5. **Why do employers lack tools?** → They need zero-cost retention solutions to compete for talent in a tough economic climate

**The ROOT ISSUE:** Trust deficit + affordability gap + lack of employer-sponsored financial wellness = employees stuck in financial stress with no viable solution.

### Problem Impact

**For Employees:**
- Limited disposable income with inflation at double digits
- Risk exposure when trying to save through unverified discount platforms
- "Can't afford even with discount" problem for essential purchases
- Time waste searching fragmented discount sources
- No employer support for financial wellness

**For Employers:**
- Talent retention challenges in competitive market
- No cost-effective employee benefits beyond health insurance
- Missing tax optimization opportunities (new 2025 Tax Act incentives)
- Poor employee engagement and productivity from financial stress

**For Merchants:**
- Difficulty reaching employed, verified customer segment
- Trust barriers for emerging brands
- High customer acquisition costs

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

**Discount Platforms (Groupon, deals.com.ng):**
- No financing options (affordability gap remains)
- No trust layer (vetting/escrow)
- No employer integration
- Generic, not workplace-focused

**BNPL Platforms (Credpal, Carbon):**
- No curated verified marketplace
- No employer benefits/stipend features
- Higher default risk without employer integration

**International Players (Amazon, Jumia):**
- Not localized for Nigerian trust concerns
- Expensive for low-income earners
- No employer partnership model

**Competitors (Motherboard/roHealth):**
- Strong on HMO/health benefits but weak on financial wellness
- No BNPL or escrow features
- App stability issues per user reviews
- "Benefits Administrator" positioning vs. "Financial Wellness" platform

**Stipends' Competitive Moat:** Employer partnerships (B2B2C model) + Trust layer (vetting + escrow) + Local market focus + Tax optimization angle + **Anti-debt mission** that competitors cannot easily replicate.

### Proposed Solution

Stipends is a **full-stack financial wellness ecosystem** that combines:

**1. Verified Merchant Marketplace**
- Aggregated discounts from established and emerging brands
- Multi-level vetting process (CAC registration, bank verification, quality checks)
- Trust badges and social proof ("X employees saved ₦Y")
- Hyper-local merchant density strategy (10-15 merchants per business district)

**2. Employer Stipend Funding**
- Monthly/quarterly allowances funded by employers into employee accounts
- Zero-cost base platform for employers
- Optional funding feature for competitive advantage
- Tax-efficient under Nigeria Tax Act 2025 (50% additional deduction) — *pending tax expert validation*

**3. Escrow Protection System**
- **Auto-applied to first-time purchases** from any merchant (trust-building for employees)
- Criteria-based escrow triggers:
  - All first purchases with a new merchant
  - Optional merchant opt-in for additional trust signal
  - High-value transactions (e.g., >₦20k) based on fraud risk scoring
- Funds held until employee confirms satisfaction
- Auto-release after 14 days with notification reminders
- Evidence-based dispute resolution
- Merchant protection policy to prevent abuse
- **Phase 2 refinement**: Limit escrow to emerging/new merchants only after trust established

**4. Seamless Payroll Integration**
- SSO with company email for minimal friction
- HR dashboard for employee management
- White-glove onboarding with ready-made communication templates  
- **Phase 2**: Automated BNPL deductions from monthly salary (when BNPL launches)

**5. Email Marketing + Full Employee App**
- **Email channel**: Weekly curated deals (1-2 offers) sent to company inbox for discovery
- **Employee PWA (Progressive Web App)**: Full marketplace browsing, checkout, savings dashboard, transaction history
- Employer-endorsed communications for trust signal
- Deep links from email to specific deals in app
- Low-bandwidth optimization for Nigerian network infrastructure



### Key Differentiators

1. **Tax Optimization as Competitive Wedge**
   - Platform leverages Nigeria Tax Act 2025: employers get 150% tax deductibility on employee welfare spending
   - Rent receipt generation feature for new Rent Relief law (requires proof of payment)
   - Positions platform as "self-funding" via tax savings

2. **Multi-Stakeholder Value Creation**
   - Employees: Trusted savings + affordability (BNPL) + employer funding
   - Employers: Zero-cost retention tool + tax shield + payroll-integrated
   - Merchants: Access to verified employed customer segment + bulk acquisition

3. **Trust Architecture**
   - Three-layer verification: Merchant vetting + Escrow protection + Employer endorsement
   - Addresses Nigeria-specific scam concerns that international platforms ignore

4. **Enterprise-Grade Integration**
   - Payroll API connections (unlike consumer-only BNPL apps)
   - SSO for corporate identity management
   - Company email channels (workplace-native distribution)

5. **Financial Wellness Positioning**
   - Not just "discounts" but comprehensive financial enablement
   - Savings tracking + Budgeting insights + Employer-funded stipends
   - Cumulative impact dashboard and gamification
   - **Anti-debt mission**: Focus on smart spending and employer support, not lending

- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** 120k employees (60 employers × 2,000 avg employees) in 18 months

**Market Timing:**
- **2025 Tax Act** creates regulatory tailwind (50% additional welfare deduction + rent relief proof requirement)
- High inflation (20%+) drives demand for savings solutions
- Employer talent competition intensifying post-pandemic
- Digital adoption accelerating (mobile money, fintech familiarity)

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**
- **Motherboard (formerly roHealth):** HMO-focused benefits platform expanding to vouchers; weak on financial wellness/BNPL
- **Eden Life:** Lifestyle concierge (food, laundry, cleaning) for professionals; premium pricing, no employer integration
- **Advantage Club (International):** Global employee perks/rewards platform; not localized for Nigerian trust/fraud concerns

**Indirect Competitors:**
- **BNPL Platforms:** Credpal, Carbon, FairMoney (no marketplace or employer features)
- **Discount/Deals Sites:** Groupon Nigeria, deals.com.ng, Jiji Deals (no trust layer or financing)
- **Payroll Advance Apps:** Earnipay, Myfaircent (salary advance only, no merchant marketplace)

**Competitive Advantage:**
- **Multi-sided network effects:** More employers → more employees → better merchant deals → more employer value
- **Regulatory moat:** Tax optimization angle requires payroll integration expertise
- **Trust moat:** Multi-layer vetting + escrow system + employer endorsement (hard to replicate)
- **First-mover in "Tax-Optimized Financial Wellness" positioning**

### Market Trends & Insights

**From Market Research:**
1. **Tax Goldmine Discovery:** Nigeria Tax Act 2025 provides self-funding mechanism for employers (150% deductibility)
2. **Hyper-Local Strategy:** Don't need 1000 merchants; need 10-15 high-quality local merchants per business district
3. **Merchant LOI Tactic:** Non-binding Letters of Intent reduce merchant risk to zero ("If you bring 500 employees, we'll offer 10% discount")
4. **Email-First Distribution:** Reduces "another app" fatigue; leverages employer trust via company email
5. **Dual-Market Positioning:** Tier merchandise ("Everyday Wins" vs. "Stipends Select") to serve both low-earners and executives

**Regulatory Landscape (PESTLE - Legal/Political):**
- **Opportunities:** Consumer protection laws favor verified platforms; NDPR compliance as competitive advantage
- **Threats:** BNPL licensing from CBN may take 9+ months; FCCPC scrutiny on terms/pricing
- **Mitigation:** Partner with licensed BNPL provider initially (Credpal/FairMoney white-label); proactive compliance as moat

**Economic Context:**
- **Opportunities:** High inflation drives savings demand; employer talent competition; preference for local deals vs. expensive imports
- **Threats:** Recession reduces discretionary spending; currency volatility affects pricing
- **Action:** Focus on essentials (food, utilities, transport) vs. luxury; conservative BNPL limits; dynamic pricing

**Social Dynamics:**
- **Opportunities:** Digital adoption rising; wellness awareness growing; peer influence culture in workplaces
- **Threats:** BNPL debt stigma; privacy concerns (employer tracking perception)
- **Action:** Frame BNPL as "smart budgeting"; transparent privacy policy (aggregate data only to employers); offline redemption options

  - PCI-DSS compliant (offloads security burden)
  - Excellent developer experience and documentation

**BNPL Infrastructure (Phase 2-3 Build):**
- **Proprietary Credit Engine:**
  - Custom scoring algorithm using payroll data + employment tenure
  - Integration with credit bureaus (CRC, FirstCentral) for negative checks
- **Loan Ledger System:**
  - Double-entry accounting for loan disbursements and repayments
  - Automated interest calculation and penalty logic (if applicable)
- **Repayment Automation:**
  - Direct payroll deduction integration (API or file-based)
  - Backup repayment method (tokenized card via Paystack)

**Authentication & Security:**
- **OAuth 2.0 / SAML SSO** for enterprise employee login (work email verification)
- **JWT tokens** for session management
- **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)** mandatory for employer admin accounts
- **End-to-end encryption** for sensitive data (BVN, NIN, salary info)
- **Payment tokenization** via Paystack (PCI-DSS compliance)

**Infrastructure:**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** or **AWS** for hosting
  - Cloud Run / ECS for containerized services
  - Cloud SQL / RDS for managed PostgreSQL
  - Cloud Storage / S3 for receipts and documents
- **Vercel** for Next.js frontend deployment (optimized for Next.js)

**DevOps:**
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring:** Sentry (error tracking), Datadog/New Relic (APM), LogRocket (session replay)
- **Alerting:** PagerDuty for critical payment/escrow failures

### Payroll Integration Strategy

**API Integrations (Priority Order):**
1. **Seamfix Payroll** (popular in Nigerian SMEs)
2. **WorkPay** (East/West Africa focus)
3. **CloudPay** (multinationals)

**Integration Pattern:**
- OAuth connection for employer authorization
- Webhook for monthly payroll cycle notifications
- BNPL deduction file submission (CSV/API)
- Reconciliation report download

**Fallback:** Manual CSV upload for employers without API-enabled payroll systems

### Compliance & Data Privacy

**NDPR (Nigeria Data Protection Regulation):**
- Data minimization (collect only necessary fields)
- Explicit consent for data processing (BNPL credit checks, employer analytics)
- Right to erasure and data portability
- Privacy policy in plain language
- Data breach notification protocol (<72 hours)

**CBN Regulations (BNPL/Lending):**
- Partner with licensed provider for Phase 1-2
- Apply for Payment Service Provider (PSP) license
- BNPL licensing process (9-12 months) in parallel with Phase 3

**KYC Requirements:**
- BVN (Bank Verification Number) for BNPL eligibility
- NIN (National Identification Number) optional
- Employer email verification for trust layer

### Scalability Considerations

**Current Architecture:** Modular Monolith (all services in single codebase but logically separated)

**Future Microservices (when needed at scale):**
- User Service (authentication, profiles)
- Transaction Service (payments, ledger)
- Credit Service (BNPL scoring, loan management)
- Notification Service (emails, SMS, push)
- Analytics Service (reporting, dashboards)

**Database Sharding:** Partition by employer_id once exceeding 100k active users

**Caching Strategy:**
- Deal feeds cached for 15 minutes (Redis)
- Merchant directory cached for 1 hour
- User session data in Redis (30-day TTL)

## Risks and Assumptions

### Strategic Risks & Mitigation

**RISK 1: Chicken-and-Egg Death Spiral**
- **Scenario:** Can't get merchants without users; can't get users without merchants
- **Warning Signs:** <15% employee activation in first pilot; merchant churn at Month 6
- **Prevention:**
  - Launch with **anchor tenant** (500+ employee employer) signed before merchant outreach
  - Pre-sign **30+ merchants** with non-binding Letters of Intent before employee launch
  - Subsidize initial merchant discounts if needed (₦5M budget)
  - Set 40% activation milestone in first 90 days as success gate
- **Assumption:** Hyperlocal density (10-15 merchants per business district) beats broad shallow coverage

**RISK 2: Regulatory Roadblock (BNPL Licensing)**
- **Scenario:** CBN approval delays 12+ months; competitor captures market while awaiting license
- **Warning Signs:** CBN approval drags past Month 12; competitor announces employer BNPL feature
- **Prevention:**
  - Start regulatory process NOW (Month 0)
  - Launch MVP **without BNPL** first (marketplace + escrow only)
  - **Build proprietary infrastructure** during wait time (Phase 2-3)
  - **No interim partner**: Avoid regulatory grey areas by waiting for full license (Phase 4 launch)
- **Assumption:** Marketplace traction sufficient to sustain growth for 18 months without BNPL revenue

**RISK 3: BNPL Default Crisis**
- **Scenario:** 35% default rate destroys unit economics; merchant payouts delayed; reputation ruined
- **Warning Signs:** Default rate >15% in first 4 months; merchant settlement complaints; negative reviews
- **Prevention:**
  - **Conservative credit limits:** ₦5k-₦20k max per employee
  - **Employer payroll deduction required** (contractual agreement with employer)
  - 6-month employment tenure requirement for BNPL eligibility
  - Partner with **credit bureaus** (CRC Credit, FirstCentral) for risk scoring
  - **Reserve fund** (10% of BNPL volume) for merchant payouts in case of defaults
- **Assumption:** Payroll integration achieves >85% collection rate (employees can't easily avoid)

**RISK 4: Escrow Abuse & Fraud**
- **Scenario:** Employees falsely claim dissatisfaction; merchants lose revenue and abandon platform
- **Warning Signs:** 25% dispute rate (vs. 5% expected); top merchants threatening to leave
- **Prevention:**
  - **Evidence-based dispute resolution** (photos, delivery confirmation required)
  - Limit escrow to **first purchase** with each emerging merchant (subsequent purchases instant settlement)
  - **Auto-release after 14 days** with 3-day notification countdown
  - AI **fraud detection** (velocity checks, pattern analysis)
  - **Merchant protection policy:** Frivolous disputes lead to employee account suspension
- **Assumption:** <5% legitimate dispute rate for quality merchants

**RISK 5: Employer Apathy**
- **Scenario:** Employers don't promote internally; usage flatlines at 8%; renewal jeopardized
- **Warning Signs:** Single launch email and no follow-up; no internal champions; HR unresponsive to inquiries
- **Prevention:**
  - **White-glove onboarding:** Dedicated customer success manager per employer
  - **Co-create launch campaign** with HR (ready-made email templates, posters, Slack announcements)
  - **Gamification:** Savings leaderboards visible to employees (social proof drives usage)
  - **Quarterly business reviews** showing ROI (tax savings, employee satisfaction scores)
  - **Incentivized internal champions:** Reward HR with bonus features or credits
- **Assumption:** Employers will promote if shown clear ROI and given easy tools

**RISK 6: Platform Fatigue ("Another App")**
- **Scenario:** Employees ignore yet another benefits platform; activation <20%
- **Warning Signs:** Low click-through rates on launch emails; high app abandonment in first session
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Email-first distribution:** 1-2 curated deals/week to company email (not app-dependent)
  - **PWA (Progressive Web App):** No app store download required; works on low-bandwidth
  - **Employer endorsement:** Launch via company email (trusted sender, not spam)
  - **Instant value:** Show personalized deals immediately upon login (no lengthy onboarding)
- **Assumption:** Email channel + employer trust overcomes app fatigue

**RISK 7: Competitor Copying (Motherboard)**
- **Scenario:** Motherboard adds BNPL and escrow features; neutralizes differentiation
- **Warning Signs:** Competitor funding announcement; feature releases matching Stipends roadmap
- **Mitigation:**
  - **Speed to market:** Launch MVP in 6 months (before competitor can pivot)
  - **Network effects moat:** Employer partnerships harder to replicate than features
  - **Tax optimization positioning:** Requires payroll integration expertise (not trivial to bolt on)
  - **Trust moat:** Multi-layer vetting + escrow is operationally complex (not just feature flag)
- **Assumption:** 6-12 month head start creates defensible employer network

### Critical Assumptions

**Business Model Assumptions:**
- Employers will pay ₦50k-₦200k/month for stipend funding feature (30% conversion target)
- Merchants will sustain 10-20% discounts for verified employee segment
- Employees will transact 2+ times/month at ₦8,000 average order value
- 40% employee activation rate achievable in 90 days

**Technical Assumptions:**
- Paystack escrow service (or partner) can handle 1,000+ concurrent escrow holds
- Payroll APIs from Seamfix/WorkPay are reliable (99%+ uptime)
- Credpal/FairMoney willing to white-label BNPL at reasonable revenue share
- PWA provides sufficient user experience (native app not required for MVP)

**Market Assumptions:**
- Nigeria Tax Act 2025 provisions remain stable (not reversed in future amendments)
- Economic conditions don't deteriorate to point of mass layoffs (shrinking TAM)
- Fraud/scam concerns remain top barrier to unverified platform adoption
- Employer talent competition continues (driving demand for retention tools)

**Regulatory Assumptions:**
- NDPR enforcement remains focused on data breaches (not over-aggressive on consent)
- CBN doesn't ban payroll-deducted BNPL models
- Partnership model with licensed BNPL provider is compliant (doesn't require separate license)

### Open Questions for Research

1. **Merchant LOI Success Rate:** What % of merchants convert from Letter of Intent to signed contract?
2. **Optimal Discount Range:** What discount % drives employee transactions without hurting merchant margins?
3. **Employer Willingness to Pay:** At what price point do employers consider stipend funding "too expensive"?
4. **BNPL Credit Limits:** What's the sweet spot between utilization and default risk (₦5k? ₦10k? ₦20k)?
5. **Employee Privacy Sensitivity:** Do employees resist platform due to "employer tracking" concerns?
